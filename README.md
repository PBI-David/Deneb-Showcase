# Deneb-Showcase

This is a collection of advanced dataviz examples using [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/), [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/), [Deneb](https://deneb-viz.github.io/) and [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/). All the work is original and where this has been inspired by the work of others, I have pointed this out.

If you'd like help with customising these charts, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn for consultancy services.

## Bank Failure Bubble Chart

I thought it would be interesting to plot the recent bank failures (as reported and managed by FDIC) against those from 2008.

## Covid Map (Animated)

An animated map using Vega showing the spread of Covid-19 across the UK using data from https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/.

Topojson can be a bit tricky to get working in the certified Deneb visual (no loading from external sources) but the .pbix below shows this can be done by embedding the topojson inline.

## Mekko Chart

A Mekko bar chart showing global miltitary spending in 2022 implemented in Vega using data from [SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex).

Mekko charts come in two main flavours:

1. A Mekko bar chart with the y-axis acting like a normal stacked bar chart but with a normalised x-axis (percentage based) so you can see the proportion taken by each major segment.
2. A Marimekko chart where both the x-axis and y-axis are normalised (percentage based).

## Pancake Spider Chart

A faceted spider chart which was my winning submission to a competition using a BBC Good Food pancake recipe dataset and built with Deneb, Vega and PowerBI. In Vega, each axis can have its own scale which is essential for comparing different dimensions.

## Sankey Chart

Sankey charts (allvuial charts) are great for visualising a business process or simplifying a complex data flow like Microsoft’s FY23 Q2 income statement.

It is very configurable and I’ve tried to account for as many edge cases I can think of.

## TopN Donut Chart

You’ve probably read that pie charts should be avoided at all costs in your reports but is this advice based on any actual evidence? Leland Wilkinson (author of the Grammar of Graphics which serves as the foundation for every modern data viz library) wrote the following:

> I've heard a few opinions here about pie charts that are unsupportable. Statisticians (and designers like Tufte) rant about pie charts and their negativism creeps into blogs that users take for gospel. These rants are not based on solid psychological research and they are made by people who have no training in psychology. Allow me a story.

You can read his full thoughts here:
https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/pull/5676#issuecomment-565731079

The conclusion is that pie charts should be your _preferred choice_ for proportion of whole data but only when there are 7 or fewer categories.

Here is a Vega donut chart with TopN & Others functionality including an algorithm for non overlapping labels.

## Waffle Charts

Waffle charts break a lot of dataviz best practices but sometimes, you just need a striking visual to make the numbers stand out and pop in a report. They can also be ideal for infographics.

As well as the faceted percentage example below, I have also included versions for faceted absolute, stacked absolute and stacked percentage as each have their place.
