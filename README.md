# Deneb-Showcase

This is a collection of advanced dataviz examples using [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/), [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/), [Deneb](https://deneb-viz.github.io/) and [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/). All the work is original and where this has been inspired by the work of others, I have pointed this out.

## Bank Failure Bubble Chart

I thought it would be interesting to plot the recent bank failures (as reported and managed by FDIC) against those from 2008.

## Covid Map (Animated)

An animated map using Vega showing the spread of Covid-19 across the UK using data from https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/.

Topojson can be a bit tricky to get working in the certified Deneb visual (no loading from external sources) but the .pbix below shows this can be done by embedding the topojson inline.

## Pancake Spider Chart

A faceted spider chart which was my winning submission to a competition using a BBC Good Food pancake recipe dataset and built with Deneb, Vega and PowerBI. In Vega, each axis can have its own scale which is essential for comparing different dimensions.

## Sankey Chart

Sankey charts (allvuial charts) are great for visualising a business process or simplifying a complex data flow like Microsoft’s FY23 Q2 income statement.

It is very configurable and I’ve tried to account for as many edge cases I can think of.

## Waffle Charts

Waffle charts break a lot of dataviz best practices but sometimes, you just need a striking visual to make the numbers stand out and pop in a report. They can also be ideal for infographics.

As well as the faceted percentage example below, I have also included versions for faceted absolute, stacked absolute and stacked percentage as each have their place.
